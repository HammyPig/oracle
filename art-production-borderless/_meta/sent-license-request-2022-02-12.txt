Subject: Usage/License query, Images edition

Hello,

I have created a personal card game which uses freepik resources as supplementary art for the cards. Specifically, each card in the card game has a name and description, where an icon derived from freepik resources is used in a complementary nature above the name and description (corresponding to the text contents). All cases of this usage can be found on https://oraclecardgame.com/cards for you to view.

In the freepik Terms of use (8. License Agreement for Freepik Content), it states the user may use the resources provided that it "Does not use the content in the Freepik Content in printed or electronic items ... aimed to be resold, in which the content in the Freepik Content is the main element..." As the main content is the card game concept itself, the freepik resources used as icons are not the main content, as the art (whether or not it is freepik content) can be changed at anytime with little to no effect on the game itself. Rather, the card game would be sold for the game concept.

Considering this, I believe I am able to sell copies of the card game under the free license while using the resources as supplementary art for the cards.

Please advise if the above is false, and if so, provide the segments of the license which inhibits the ability to sell copies of my card game considering the above facts. Please also make me aware if any other issues arise.

Regards, James
