Potential buffs for players

	Players use

		Cards - Farm
		Health - Walls
		Other players
			Cards - ?
			Motives - ?
		Attack - Army (Garrison?)
		Defend - Same as walls

Picking up cards, beginning or end of turn?

	For Beginning:
		Beginning, more intuitive
		If you use defend cards, you seem 'limited' at your turn as you have less cards.

	For end:
		You have the whole round to think about what you are going to play next turn.

	Pickup at both beginning and end
		?

	Things to consider:
		IF ALL PLAYERS PICKUP AT THE END OF THEIR TURN:
		People can't guess what is in your hand, because you always have 5 cards.
		Exchanges seem better as everyone has 5 cards to exchange

Spell Tower (Spelltower?) yes or no

	Yes
		Fun to unlock something new
		Better for strategy somehow

	No
		Once you get it, all the other spell tower cards are useless.
			Give spell towers another buff?
				Spell tower owner can use 2, everyone else uses 1
		
		Freezes spell cards


Feeling 'stuck' with cards

	Trading cards for something ???
		Trade attack cards for spell cards.

	Increase the amount of spell towers.

	You can 'recycle' cards at the end of your turn.
		Concerns
			Deck needs to be reshuffled
				Why?
					People will know what cards will be next
						How will people know what the next 50 cards are?
						How will people know which card each player put down?
							"I have so many spell cards"
								What if they are lying, or are they just an idiot
						They put the same cards down in that order
							What if the next player picks up the cards in that order
								Why is that bad?
									Assuming the person who put down the cards meant that their cards were bad
										What makes the cards bad
											Why do you wanna reshuffle the cards?
												You were not able to use them at the time
													When the next player picks up your cards, they will be able to use them
														Why? Spell towers are always available
															What if a player doesnt want to put down a spell tower
																Why would they do that
																	Because they know the other player has a spell and doesnt want them to use it


	Combine army and buildings into one
	Yes
		Simplifies
		More intuitive
	Name for army:
		Retain army
		Change to garrison
	
	Solution:
	Army is now classed as a building:
		No longer:
			Corrupt: Steal an army from play
			Lifesteal: Destroy an army, heal yourself by 1
	Increase building count

	Decrease number of cards related to buildings


Change name of castle to wall
	Yes
		Wall seems more intuitive to me
	No
		Its like when you castle a king






Maximum amount of cards in hand
	Needs to be odd number
	5 because 7 is too much
