Oracle (rip Blind Kings)

AT THE START:
Players start off with 5 cards each.
Each player starts with ONE army in PLAY.
Players start with 5 health.
Shuffle and pile the cards into the centre. This is the pickup pile. The trash pile will go next to this.
Whenever a card is discarded, it must go into the trash pile and cannot be used for the rest of the game.
If a card is recycled, place it at the bottom of the pickup pile.
Once all cards have been exhausted, the player with the most health wins.

After each turn, the player must pick up cards until they have 5 cards.
Players take turns clockwise
