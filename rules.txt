Oracle

AT THE START:
Each player is handed a role at random. No one knows each other's role.
Shuffle and pile the cards into the centre for players to pick up from.
Players start with 5 health and 5 cards each.
The Crown reveals themself and wears the party hat. The Crown takes the first turn.

EVERY TURN:
You can never show your role to another player. This does not stop you from lying about your role.
During their turn, players may use any number of cards on any player unless said otherwise. By default, you can use ATTACK only once per turn.
Whenever a card is used or discarded, it must go into a trash pile and cannot be used for the rest of the game.
If a card is reshuffled, place it next to the pickup pile. This will become the new pickup pile once all other cards have been used.
After each turn, the player must pick up cards until they have (by default) 5 cards.
Players take turns clockwise.
When a player dies, they must reveal their role to all other players.
