Hello,

I am interested in purchasing some vectors from freepik.com from the user @upklyak.

I have a couple vectors of interest that I would like to purchase.

Is this the correct place to contact you? When I clicked on the profile, it linked me to the https://onepiconebook.com/ website, where I found this email.

Regards,
James

Hello, James!

My name is Mila, I am an account manager at MyTeam.Art.

Would you like to purchase a custom illustration or something already made that you saw on the platform?

Hello Mila!

Would you be able to inform me on the pricing of both new custom illustrations as well as purchasing already existing illustrations on the freepik platform.

Thanks,
James

Sure, James.
For illustration creation, we can suggest two rates.
1. Fixed-rate (90$).
If you choose a fixed-rate variant, there would be no need for prepayment, and you can also pay when the illustrations are ready. However, no edits/corrections/alterations are possible.
2. Hourly rate (50$/h).
This variant on the contrary gives you the freedom to suggest edits whatever you need. Usually, it takes about 10 hours to make an illustration, and we can offer a step payment (for example, for every 4 hours).
In both cases, you will get an extended business license but all the copyrights will remain in the studio, which means - we will sell the created illustrations in the future.

As for existing illustrations on the freepik platform - some of them are free for download, some require a premium subscription. For example, this illustration is free for download https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/space-game-background-neon-night-alien-landscape_7671274.htm#query=upklyak&position=34&from_view=search
When you click the download button, you can follow the link to get the necessary details about the premium subscription price. The license details are placed on the same page.
If you choose a free download, please, don't forget about the attribution link :)

Hi Mila,

I intend to sell products which feature free to download freepik content (made by you guys). However, under both the free and premoum freepik license, I would be unable to.

Would I be able to instead purchase a license directly from you guys, so I am able to sell products featuring free vectors you have uploaded to freepik?

Regards,
James

Ok, I understand. For sure, we can provide you with the license.
It will cost only 10$ per illustration. However, we need to know for what project you are going to use it.
Please describe how exactly you want to use the images and then we'll be able to give you the extended license :)

Thanks for the information.

I am creating a personal card game which I intend to sell.

Each of the cards has an icon, where I am interested in including your art. Some examples are attached to this email (attack.jpg and defend.jpg), where I have taken some of the vector resources from here: https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/ancient-greek-spartan-roman-warrior-gladiator-with-sword-shield_15421170.htm and modified them slightly. I intend to do this with each of the cards in my card game.

I have several illustrations of interest that I would like to purchase. Let me know if there are any other questions!

What are the specific details of the extended license?

Thank you for the description, James!

You can use the illustrations you've found on freepik for free. In your case, you don't need to pay for the license :) All we ask is to add an attribution link to MyTeam.Art in your game somewhere.

Just in case you'll need a custom illustration from us - we'd love to help.
1. We can suggest a fixed-rate (90$).
If you choose a fixed-rate variant, there would be no need for prepayment, and you can also pay when the illustrations are ready. However, no edits/corrections/alterations are possible.
2. Another option - hourly rate (50$/h).
This variant on the contrary gives you the freedom to suggest edits whatever you need. Usually, it takes about 10 hours to make an illustration, and we can offer a step payment (for example, for every 4 hours).
In both cases, you will get an extended business license but all the copyrights will remain in the studio, which means - we will sell the created illustrations in the future.

Hi Mila,

I have compiled all the uses of your guys art (under the freepik account upklyak) in the card game here:
https://oraclecardgame.com/credits

The bottom rows contain all the cards using @upklyak resources. You are able to click on the card name (in the left column) to view the card, and click on source (right column) to view where the art was pulled from.

Just to be clear, freepik advised me that I would not be able to sell the card game using the resources from you guys on freepik. Are you giving me permission so I am able to sell the card game with regards to your resources?

Also, would you prefer me to put 'Vector created by MyTeam.Art' in the attribution section on my website instead of 'vector created by pch.vector - www.freepik.com'?

Thanks for all the information, I greatly appreciate it!

Regards,
James

Hi, James,

You are right - we're giving you permission to do that. As for the attribution, we'd prefer the 'Vector created by MyTeam.Art' variant :)
Good luck with your Oracle game promotion/sales!
