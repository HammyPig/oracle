Hello,

I have created a personal card game which uses freepik resources as supplementary art for the cards. Specifically, each card in the card game has a name and description, where an icon derived from freepik resources is used in a complementary nature above the name and description (corresponding to the text contents). All cases of this usage can be found on https://oraclecardgame.com/cards for you to view.

In the freepik Terms of use (8. License Agreement for Freepik Content), it states the user may use the resources provided that it "Does not use the content in the Freepik Content in printed or electronic items ... aimed to be resold, in which the content in the Freepik Content is the main element..." As the main content is the card game concept itself, the freepik resources used as icons are not the main content, as the art (whether or not it is freepik content) can be changed at anytime with little to no effect on the game itself. Rather, the card game would be sold for the game concept.

Considering this, I believe I am able to sell copies of the card game under the free license while using the resources as supplementary art for the cards.

Please advise if the above is false, and if so, provide the segments of the license which inhibits the ability to sell copies of my card game considering the above facts. Please also make me aware if any other issues arise.

Regards, James

, and it is the mail element of  each card.

 You must add other third party designs or self made images that have more =
weight than ours.

as the main element of the design since all the images belong to Freepik.

Please be aware that this rule applies to free and premium users.

If you download Freepik resources as a free user you must include the attri=
bution line 'Designed by Freepik' on the products you are willing to sell a=
nd a link referring www.freepik.com placed on your website. In case you don=
't want to include this attribution line, you must purchase any of Freepik =
Plans.

Hello,

Thanks for the clarification.

When using freepik images as the main element, it states that it can be
used for personal use, where it says you are unable to sell your products.

Does this mean I am able to give away the products (for free) under this
definition?

Regards,
James
