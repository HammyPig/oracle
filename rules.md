# Oracle Rules

## How to Play

Each player is given a role card at random. You can never show your role card to another player, but you can claim to be any role.

To win the game, the targets specified on your role card must be killed. This is done through using your cards to damage (or help!) other players. You are killed when your health reaches zero, and cannot win when killed.


<b>Only one player can win.</b>

Most importantly, be sure to pay as much attention to stopping other players from killing their targets.

During your turn, you can use any number of cards on any player. The only exception is the ATTACK card, which is limited to being used once per turn. Building cards can be placed in front of you to increase this limit along with other special perks.

After your turn, you must pick up from the pile until you reach your base hand limit of 5 cards.

Once the pile is exhausted, simply reshuffle and continue play.

## Setup

Each player is handed a health bar card and a role card at random. You can use your role card to keep track of your health by sliding it over the hearts.

Shuffle and pile the rest of the cards into the centre. Players start with 5 cards.

The Crown must reveal their role and takes the first turn. Turns are then taken clockwise.
