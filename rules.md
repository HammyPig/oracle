# Oracle Rulebook

## Summary of Gameplay

Each player will be given a role card at random. You can never show your role card to another player, but this does not stop you from claiming to be a role.

To win the game, you must target and help kill whoever is specified on your role card. This is done through using offensive cards (red text).

You may use a DEFEND card to block an offensive card played on ANYONE, even if it is not your turn.

An ATTACK card is the most common offensive card, but these are limited to being used once per turn. You can increase your attack limit through owning buildings.

Buildings are a type of card in BLACK TEXT, which when placed in front of you, will give you a buff until removed by some card.

You may use all cards (excluding ATTACK) any number of times on any player during your turn. After your turn, you must pick up until you have 5 cards.
