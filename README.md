# Oracle

Oracle is a thrilling blend of battle and social deduction. Perfect for casual meetups and parties, it is extremely easy to learn and play, with simple rules and a playtime of 15-30 minutes.

In Oracle, each player is given a secret role card. On it is an objective to eliminate specific players, but the catch is, no one knows who is who. Through observation alone, you must deduce who those players are.

Use your cards to construct powerful buildings, launch strategic attacks, and defend would-be allies, all for the sake of completing your objective before anyone else.

## How to Play

Each player is given a secret role card. Reveal your role once eliminated.

On your role card is an objective. The first person to complete their objective wins the game.

During your turn, you can play any number of cards. After your turn, pick up from the pile until you reach your hand limit of 5 cards.

### Important Cards

ATTACK can only be used once per turn.

DEFEND is used outside of your turn to help you or other players.

Building cards give special perks when placed in front of you.

### Rules

Only one player can win, except The Crown and Knight.

If you are eliminated, you cannot win.

You cannot put down cards without using their effect.

### Setup

When playing with 4 players, remove the Cultist role.

Give each player a health bar and random role card.

Shuffle the cards and place the ORACLE card at the bottom.

Players start with 5 cards.

The Crown must reveal their role and take the first turn.

Turns are then taken clockwise.

### Player Roles

ROLES | OBJECTIVE
--- | ---
The Crown | Eliminate all who oppose you.
Demon Lord | Exterminate all other players.
Usurper | Execute The Crown.
Knight | Protect The Crown (even if it kills you!)
Cultist | Slay The Crown and Knight.
