# Oracle

A card game which does not believe that complexity and strategy must sacrifice beginner friendliness.

It aims to be a game that can be easily picked up among a group of friends or strangers. However, unlike other common go-to games, it strives to require a more thrilling and dynamic experience.

## Rules

### How to Play

Each player is given a secret role card. You can claim to be any role but cannot show it.

To win, the targets on your role card must be killed. Use any number of cards during your turn.

After your turn, pick up from the pile until you reach your base hand limit of 5 cards.

There are 3 special cards to remember:

ATTACK can only be used once per turn.

DEFEND is used outside of your turn to help you or other players.

Building cards give you special perks when placed in front of you.

Once the pile is exhausted, simply reshuffle and continue play.

<b>Only one player can win.</b> Be sure to pay as much attention to stopping other players from killing their targets.

### Setup

If there are less than 5 players, remove the bottom roles first. Each player is given a health bar and secret role card. Keep track of your health by sliding your role card over the hearts.

Shuffle and pile the rest of the cards into the centre. Place the ORACLE card at the bottom.

Players start with 5 cards.

The Crown must reveal their role and take the first turn. Turns are taken clockwise.
