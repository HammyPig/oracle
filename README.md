# Oracle

Oracle is a thrilling blend of battle and social deduction. Perfect for casual meetups and parties, it is extremely easy to learn and play, with simple rules and a playtime of 15-30 minutes.

In Oracle, each player is given a secret role card. On it is an objective to eliminate specific players, but the catch is, no one knows who is who. Through observation alone, you must deduce who those players are.

Use your cards to construct powerful buildings, launch strategic attacks, and defend would-be allies, all for the sake of completing your objective before anyone else.

## How to Play

Each player is given a secret role card. On your role card is an objective. The first person to complete their objective wins the game.

### Setup

When playing with 4 players, remove the Cultist role.

Give each player a health bar and random role card.

Shuffle the deck and place it face down in the middle.

Place the ORACLE card at the bottom of the deck.

Players start with 5 cards.

The Crown must reveal their role and take the first turn.

Turns are then taken clockwise.

### Taking Your Turn

You can play any number of cards, but the ATTACK card can only be used once per turn.

The DEFEND card blocks any offensive card (coloured in red) and can be used at any time.

Building cards (coloured in orange) are placed in front of you and give bonuses until removed.

After your turn, pick up from the pile until you reach your hand limit of 5 cards.

If the pile runs out, simply reshuffle the deck and continue play.

### Ending The Game

Keep track of your health by sliding your role card over your health bar.

When eliminated, you can no longer win and must reveal your role.

Only one player can win, except The Crown and Knight.

### Player Roles

ROLES | OBJECTIVE
--- | ---
The Crown | Eliminate all who oppose you.
Demon Lord | Exterminate all other players.
Usurper | Execute The Crown.
